# Diabetes_Prediction

One of the most prevalent diseases in the world, diabetes has an increasing prevalence throughout time. Although the primary cause of diabetes is still unknown, scientists think that both hereditary and environmental lifestyle factors play a significant influence in the disease.

Research on the Pima tribe, an American tribe, was conducted a few years ago . It was discovered that the women of this tribe get diabetes quite early. These instances were chosen from a bigger database under a number of restrictions. To be specific, all patients were Pima Native women who were at least 21 years old.

The attributes in the dataset are:

Pregnancies: number of pregnancies


Glucose: In an oral glucose tolerance test, the plasma glucose concentration at two hours.

Blood pressure: (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: (mm)

Insulin: (mu U/ml) 

BMI

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Calculates the likelihood of having diabetes on basis of genetics.

Age: Years of age

Outcome: A binary class variable 

Here, we are performing exploratory data analysis and developing a classification model to analyse several elements of diabetes in the Pima Indian tribe.
